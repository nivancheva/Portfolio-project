                I've started my journey in January this year by
                learning HTML and CSS from the documentation at W3School
                and MDN web docs. When i gain some knowledge i
                started doing chalanges from Frontend Mentor.
                When i started learning Javascript I enrolled in
                codecademy courses. You will be able to see more about
                the projects and certificates acquired during my Traningin 
                in my github page.
